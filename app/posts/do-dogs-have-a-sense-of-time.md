<p>Sense of time is connected to memory. This is why it’s common for humans with memory loss (such as amnesia) to have a distorted perception of time. Animal memory is thought to be much more simplistic than human memory, and dogs have episodic memories, which means they are only able to remember certain events in their life. While your dog will remember you leaving the house, they most likely won’t understand how long you were away. When dogs are left alone, sometimes they become stressed (stemming from their separation anxiety), indicating that they have an awareness of the passage of time.</p>

<b>Can Dogs Tell Time?</b>
<br />
<br />
<p>Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.</p>
<br />
<p>Fun fact: Dogs can smell the passing of time. Fur-real? Well, dogs can sense the changes in the air. For example, hot air rises over the course of an afternoon, and dogs can sense this.</p>
