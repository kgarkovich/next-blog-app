<b>History</b>
<p>Funicular derives from the Latin word funiculus, which translates to “rope”. That’s what they used to be made from! There were rope cables in the funicular loop system powered by either humans or animals. The oldest known funicular is in Hohensalzburg Castle, and it’s known as the Reisszug. Though now being run by a metal cart, cables, and an electric motor, the Reisszug has been in operation since the early 1500s!</p>
<br />
<p>The Incline opened in November of 1895 and was constructed by John Crass and the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway Company. The cars originally operated on coal-burning steam engines, which were upgraded to two 100-horsepower motors in 1911. The Incline Railway has been transporting eager passengers up Lookout Mountain for over 125 years!</p>
